silk touch blocks: false
# Should explosions silk-touch blocks?
#   The tool being mimicked is a Diamond Pickaxe.
# Note: This overrides handling of all blocks except tnt by the game. 
#   While this shouldn't conflict with other plugins; it may if they do not handle explosion events properly.

# to disable physics you need to add "EVERYTHING" to "disabled falling blocks"
physics:
  
  # By how much should we multiply the velocity
  velocity multiplier: 2.0
  
  # Raytracing is used to help plot a more "fun" trajectory for the falling blocks.
  # How many times should the ray bounce off non-passable blocks (casting a new ray in that direction)
  # If no attempts are made explosions will just push blocks away from the blast (usually down)
  max ray attempts: 5
  
  # How far should each ray travel?
  max ray distance: 10
  
  # How many ticks should we wait before resending block updates
  # (This is for fixing a client side ghost block issue.)
  # The higher this value the more memory will be consumed & the less cinematic it may appear.
  # Default is 5.
  ticks before update: 2
  
  # Should falling blocks "squish" entities they fall on?
  # This behaves the same as anvil damage.
  falling blocks hurt entities: true
  
  # Should falling blocks play their blocks break animation if they fail to land?
  play falling break animation: true
  
  # Any blocks in this list will be broken rather then flung
  # Note: All tile-entities are already excluded as well as TNT
  # Setting a value of "EVERYTHING" will include all known materials.

  # Any blocks in this list will not be placed if they land. 
  #  instead dropping their loot table's items on impact (unless disabled)
  # Setting a value of "EVERYTHING" will include all known materials.
  disabled falling blocks placement:
    - NETHER_PORTAL # you probably don't want this
    - FIRE # can place in odd ways that look strange.
    
  # Falling blocks in this list will never drop items.
  # Setting a value of "EVERYTHING" will include all known materials.
  disabled falling block drops:
    - NETHER_PORTAL # just in case.
    - FIRE # just in case.

# Hooks are for integration with some supported plugins 
hooks:
  # CoreProtect block logging hooks
  # Note: You must enable the CoreProtect API in it's config for this to work!
